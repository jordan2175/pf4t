## Usage

When working with Trello boards, it is often beneficial to be able to group and
filter cards by various means and the native labels feature is too primitive.
This Chrome extension will allow you to group cards by a category (e.g., home,
work, school, etc) and then also be able to add various tags, hashtags, and
priority flags to each card. There are three types of tags so that you can
organize your tags however you want. One way is you could have the different
tags represent a nesting of up to three levels deep. I did it this way to make
it extremely flexible. In addition, you can add a cost value, a story points
value, and a time value to each card. The nice thing is you can do this all
directly in the card title. You do not need to click around and do extra
things.


## Syntax

- Category: `Category | Task name`
- Square Labels: `[label]`
- Curly Labels: `{label}`

- Hashtags: `#hashtag`
- Priority: `!` (low), `!!` (med), `!!!` (high)
- Time: `[~5]` (hours)
